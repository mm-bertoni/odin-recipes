    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking Sheet</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Carrots</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 TSP Salt</li>
        <li>0.25 TSP Black Pepper</li>
        <li>0.5 TSP Garlic Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with high-heat-resistant parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the carrot slices on paper towels to remove excess water. Transfer them to a large bowl and toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Spread the carrot slices in one layer on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake them until browned and crispy, for about 20 min</li>
        <li>If the carrots are not evenly sliced and some slices are still not crispy, remove the crispy ones to a plate and continue baking for about 5 more minutes to crisp up the thicker slices. Watch them closely to make sure they don’t burn.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, alone or with your favorite dip.</li>
    </ol>
